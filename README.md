MultiTimer App
--------------

I've been looking for a very simple timer app with a short list of requirements:

- Can run multiple timers at once.
- Easy/fast to add new timers.
- Timers have a simple lable which you can easily set or not set.
- Isn't junked up with a bunch of other things like a stopwatch, world time, etc.

Having not found it and looking for an excuse to do some mobile app design, I decided
to make my own. This represents a prototype to help in design.

Currently using the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) framework, which is a nice mashup
of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and excellent client-side MV* framework and 
[Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/), which "is a platform for building native mobile
applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript".
